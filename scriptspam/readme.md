# scriptspam
A script which spams whatever text file you wish. There are two text files provided for you, the bee movie and some random thingy I found off the interwebz
## How to run
1. Clone this folder
2. Make sure you have pyautogui installer, if not
```
pip install pyautogui
```
3. Run spammer.py
4. Profit
## Changing the code to your preferences
You can change the text file from the default bee movie text file to the random text file by adjusting line 3, instead of “bee”, change it to “tandc”.
You can also change the sleep time (located in line 2) so that you can either have more or less time to prepare yourself for chaos
## How to stop the code
Honestly I don’t know too. I just quickly press the stop button in PyCharm when I want to stop.
If you are using python in a terminal window, you can probably just exit out of that.
